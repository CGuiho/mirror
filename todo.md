# GUIHO Mirror TODO List

## Python Versioning Support

Add support for reading and updating Python package versions in Mirror. Initial planning should clarify which Python metadata files are in scope, such as `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `setup.py`, package `__init__.py`, or another project convention.

## Python Source-To-Target Version Sync

Add an option for Python version propagation from a source project to a target project. Initial planning should define what "source" and "target" mean for Python projects, how the target version is selected or derived, and whether this should be a CLI option, configuration field, or both.
